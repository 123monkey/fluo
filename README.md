Build resources for fluo-io projects

This project uses [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][semver], with its API being the
resources it contains. Breaking changes, such as the removal of a resource,
will increment the major version, new resources and other non-breaking changes
will increment the minor version, and bugfixes to existing resources will
increment the patch version.
